## Machine Learning?

** My Definition ** 

Machine learning is a study of **algorithmic and statistical** techniques to perform **outcome-measurable** tasks
with **minimally** using explicit instructions.

Machine learning is one of the key engines for artificial intelligence to work.

_Just FYI, what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) says_

> Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

## About Me

Currently, I am
- Adjunct Professor at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html)
- Principal Scientist (part-time) at [WithMe Health, Inc.](http://withme.health/)
- Principal at [Bonsai Research, LLC.](https://bonsairesearch.com/)

Most recently, I worked for [7-Eleven, Inc.](https://www.7-eleven.com/)leading a team of data scientists to automate their inventory management and analyze consumer behaviors. 
Before that, I worked for [Evolent Health, Inc.](https://www.evolenthealth.com/) as Managing Director of AI Solutions. 
I joined Evolent through the acquisition of my start-up, a healthcare analytics start-up, [Accordion Health, Inc.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accordion-health#section-overview), which I co-founded right after getting my Ph.D. degree from [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). 
I received my degree by studying various algorithms in machine learning and their healthcare applications.

## Course Schedule

Machine learning is a rapidly evoling research decipline.
We cover both 1) the ones that are time-tested and 2) recently popularized.


---

## Things Not Covered Here

- Bayesian Models
- Unsupervised Learning
	- Clustering
	- Topic Modeling
- Time Series Models
- Learning Theory

---

## Logistics

- Please check the course website
- https://github.com/yubin-park/cs534
- Regularly updated

---

## Homework \#0

- Follow the link on the course website, or
- https://github.com/yubin-park/cs534/blob/master/homework/hw0.md
- Should take an hour to three hours (max)
- This course is a Computer Science course, so you would "code" a lot
- The homework is to test your knowledge with reading data files, slicing the data, visualizing, and find any patterns
