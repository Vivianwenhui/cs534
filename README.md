# CS534 - Machine Learning

This repository contains course materials for [CS 534 - Machine Learning](https://www.cs.emory.edu/courses/atlas/graduate/) provided in Fall 2019 at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

Course syllabus, slides, and homeworks are largely adopted from Professor Joyce Ho's [CS534 class](https://joyceho.github.io/course/cs534_f18/).

## Policy

## Honor Code

All class work is governed by the College Honor Code and Departmental Policy. 
It is acceptable and encouraged to discuss homeworks with other students. 
However, this should be noted on your submitted homework and all code and writeup must be written by yourself. 
Any code and writeup that is found to be similar is grounds for an honor code investigation by the Director of Gradute Studies, Laney Graduate School, and the honor council. 
Additional extensions on assignments will be granted with appropriate documentation from the Office of Undergraduate Education (OUE).
