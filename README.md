# CS534 - Machine Learning

This repository serves course materials, such as course schedule and lecture slides, for [CS 534 - Machine Learning](https://www.cs.emory.edu/courses/atlas/graduate/) provided in Fall 2019 at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

Course syllabus, lecture slides, and homeworks are largely adopted from prior [CS534 classes](https://joyceho.github.io/course/cs534_f18/) that were kindly provided by Professor Joyce Ho. 

Course materials with the `md` extension are [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.
To read the Markdown files, you can use various "free" Markdown viewer applications out there.
Some example applications are:
- [Markdown Viewer Chrome Add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=en)
- [Slide-style View using Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)

## Honor Code

All class work is governed by the College Honor Code and Departmental Policy. It is acceptable and encouraged to discuss homeworks with other students. However, this should be noted on your submitted homework and all code and writeup must be written by yourself. Any code and writeup that is found to be similar is grounds for an honor code investigation by the Director of Gradute Studies, Laney Graduate School, and the honor council. Additional extensions on assignments will be granted with appropriate documentation from the Office of Undergraduate Education (OUE)
